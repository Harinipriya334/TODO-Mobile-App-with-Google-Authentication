# Katomaran Todo Task App

This is a cross-platform Todo Task Management Mobile App built with [Flutter/React Native] for the Katomaran hackathon. The app supports social login, full CRUD operations on tasks, and offline usage with a clean and intuitive UI.

- Create, read, update, complete, and delete tasks  
- Task fields: title, description, due date, status, and priority  
- Local state storage for the session  
- Tabs, filters, search, floating action button, and no-data state  
- Smooth animations, pull-to-refresh, and swipe-to-delete  
- Crash reporting integrated  
- Designed with a proven design pattern for scalability and maintainability

## Setup & Run

Clone the repo, install dependencies, configure authentication, and run on device or emulator.

## Assumptions
